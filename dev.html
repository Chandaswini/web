<p> Respected sir/madam, </p>
     <p> My name is Chandaswini, graduated in the year 2022 in BE CSE from VTU. I applied for the role from the Internshala on the Web Development Internship, for the same I received the task from Mr Vaibhav on 27 June 2023. </p> 
<p> Here are the details, I really like to do the comparison between the two task; (two webpage) </p>

<p> Sometimes the load of the page depends on the network used by the user and the locations.</p>

<p> I did run the page in no throttling mode.</p>

<p> When I go through the first web page that is Schools in Dehradun, I checked the load of the webpage through the inspect [(right click-> network -> (ctrl+r)];  Load: 5.29 s </p>

<p> And the second web page is International Schools in India, I checked the load of the webpage through the inspect [(right click-> network -> (ctrl+r)];  Load: 4.62 s.</p>

<p>Web page Load varies;</p>

<p>However the ideal time to load the webpage is between 0-2 sec, sometimes 3 sec doesn't cause a problem.
Both web pages are beyond the ideal time.</p>

<p>Well, web page load is of the technical improvement; we can improve the speed by</p>
<p>1 decreasing the image size</p>
<p>2 by caching</p>
<p>3 loading the js (java script) asynchronously</p>

<p>Above are the improvements we can do, beside these if there are any, I'm happy to learn those and do the changes as per the requirements.</p>

<p>Immediate joiner for the internship.</p>
<p>Thank you for this great platform, where I can gain knowledge and build a career.</p>

<p>Yours Sincerely, <br>
Chandaswini A M<br>
